        <p>please tell me i’m right<br>
        so i don’t have to live with this<br>
        hanging over my head</p>

        <p>and i’ll stage a heist<br>
        to take back my life,<br>
        that was stolen from me<br>
        at the dead of night</p>

        <p>and i’ve been ready<br>
        for a fight since 25,<br>
        i’ve been left<br>
        broken and bruised<br>
        and i’m a mess inside</p>

        <p>i’m off balance<br>
        i can’t tell what’s happened<br>
        does this even matter<br>
        and will i ever bounce back</p>

        <p>i’m off balance<br>
        i can’t tell what’s happened<br>
        does this even matter<br>
        and will i ever bounce back</p>

        <p>please make up your mind<br>
        give me your word and define it,<br>
        cos you and me have got<br>
        different definitions of monogamy,<br>
        i didn’t leave the house for an apology</p>

        <p>i can’t even find a cab<br>
        no charge on my phone<br>
        get me home<br>
        i won’t make it back<br>
        i thought i loved you no cap<br>
        telling everyone i knew<br>
        didn’t need to hear you say it back<br>
        i always assumed you’d had enough of me<br>
        then you took them lonely thoughts,<br>
        made them reality<br>
        thank you for looking out for me<br>
        tried to write a sad song<br>
        ended up happy</p>

        <p>i’m off balance<br>
        i can’t tell what’s happened<br>
        does this even matter<br>
        and will i ever bounce back</p>

        <p>i’m off balance<br>
        i can’t tell what’s happened<br>
        does this even matter<br>
        and will i ever bounce back</p>

        <p>please tell me i’m right<br>
        please make up your mind</p>
